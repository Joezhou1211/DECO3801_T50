Purpose of the Website
- The purpose of this website is to analyze and visualize public sentiment and information dynamics during the 2019-20 Australian bushfires using historical tweets. It aims to uncover public sentiment, key topics, and the spread of misinformation, particularly false claims about arson. The website will provide policymakers with more accurate insights to address public misconceptions and evaluate the effectiveness of government actions.

Why We Need to Create It
- This website is needed to help the government better understand public opinion and the impact of misinformation, particularly during crises like the bushfires. By analyzing historical data, the government can gain insights into public sentiment and tailor its communications to combat misinformation and build trust.

How We Can Help the Government
The website can help the government by providing:
- Analysis of how misinformation spreads, including patterns, paths, and influences.
- Insights into public feedback and sentiment in response to government actions, enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of these policies.
- Tools for policymakers to explore and download dynamic data, helping them make more informed decisions.
- Understanding Information Spread
- The website will analyze patterns of how information, including misinformation, spreads across different regions, demographics, and networks. It will reveal the influence of misinformation and how quickly it circulates in different parts of the community.

Understanding Public Feedback on Government Actions
- By tracking public sentiment in response to government actions, the website can evaluate whether government interventions are effective or if they require adjustment. Public sentiment data will provide real-time feedback, helping assess the success or failure of various measures.

Presentation of Information (Logical Flow)
The information on the website can be presented as:
- Data Overview: A general summary of public sentiment and key issues during the bushfires.
- Sentiment Analysis: Visual representations (graphs or maps) showing how public sentiment evolved over time.
- Misinformation Detection: A breakdown of false claims and how they spread.
- Public Feedback: Sentiment analysis in relation to government actions.
- Real-Time Tools: Features like data downloads and exploration for analysts.

In-Depth Analysis (Radicalization Risk for Animal and Environmental Advocates):
- The project considers the risk of radicalization among groups such as animal and environmental protection advocates, especially if they perceive government inaction. By analyzing how inaction might influence public sentiment within these groups, the website can highlight the potential consequences of not addressing their concerns, possibly leading to more extreme positions.
