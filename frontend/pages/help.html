                    <h4>World Map</h4>
                    <p>On the World Map, you can see the tweet volumes visualized through the intensity of color. The darker the color, the more tweets have been posted in that area. The right sidebar will show the global tweet count, fake news count, and the percentage of fake news among the total tweets.</p>
                    <h4>Continent Map</h4>
                    <p>When switching to the Continent Map, you can zoom into one continent and view its data in greater detail.

                <p>The Publishing Data feature is not yet available on Blaze Insight, but we are working to bring it to you soon. This upcoming functionality will allow authorized government users to upload, share, and manage datasets directly within the platform. Once live, this feature will provide a secure way for government personnel to contribute important data, ensuring that all uploaded datasets meet privacy and ethical standards.
